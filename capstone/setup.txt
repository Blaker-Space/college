To setup your machine to run the frontend and the postgres server:

** Open VS Code and open a bash shell **
1. Open Visual Studio Code, press "CTRL + `" to open a terminal.

2. Click on the down arrow icon at the top of your terminal window next to "+".

3. Select "bash".



** Update and install git **
4. In your bash terminal, run "sudo apt update" and type in your password.

5. In the same bash terminal, run "sudo apt install git", then run the command "git --version" to verify it installed correctly.



** Navigate to your preferred directory and clone the Github repo **
(If you already have the repo on a local device then transition to step 9)

6. Run "ls" in the terminal, this stands for "list" and will show you the sub-folders of your current folder.

7. navigate to the folder in which you want to clone the Github repository by typing "cd <folder-name>" 
    where <folder-name> is the name of the sub-folder shown by running "ls".
    7.1 The standard is to create a "repos" folder in your root folder by running "mkdir repos" and then run "cd repos" to enter it.

8. run "git clone https://Github.com/BradBear19/Location-Based-Web-Crawler.git"
    8.1 If prompted to enter name and email, enter in email associated with Github account.



** Install Dependencies to get server to run **
9. Run "cd Location-Based-Web-Crawler" in a newly created terminal to change directories to the Github repo you just cloned

10. In the same temrinal, run "cd server" to enter the server directory

11. In the same temrinal, run "npm i express pg cors" to install express.js, postgres, and cross-origin resource sharing, also run "npm install nodemon"

12. In the same temrinal, run "nodemon index" inside of the "server" folder to start the server on your machine



** Set up Database **
14. Go to www.pgadmin.org, install pgadmin 4

15. Open pgadmin 4, right-click on "Servers" in the left menu, select "Register", "Server..."

16. Name it whatever you want in "General", go to "Connection", and set Host name to localhost and port to whatever port number you want to use (5432 should be good)

17. Set Username and Password to whatever you want it to be (be sure to remember this!)

18. Copy code found in server/sql-scripts/01-schema.sql, paste in pgadmin 4 and execute

19. do the same as above for 02-indexes.sql

** Set up .env file and populate with appropriate data **
20. create a file in the "server" folder named ".env"

21. copy the following and paste in your .env file:

PGUSER=
PGPASSWORD=
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=postgres

23. next to PGUSER, type in the username you made in step 15

24. for PGPASSWORD, type in your postgres password you made (if applicable)

25. put localhost for PGHOST, the port you chose in 14 for PGPORT, and the name you chose in 14 for PGDATABASE



** Set up client **
26. Change directories to the "client" by opening a new bash terminal (same process as step 2 & 3) and running "cd Location-Based-Web-Crawler/client"

27. Execute the command "run npm install" in the newly created bash terminal.

28. run "npm start" to start the client. If you visit localhost:3000 on your web browser, you should see the front-end

29. All set up! Add in data to your database from the front end as you please!
