To setup your machine to run the frontend and the server:

** Open VS Code and open a bash shell **
1. open visual studio code, press "CTRL + `" to open a terminal

2. click on the down arrow icon at the top of your terminal window next to "+"

3. select "bash"



** Update and install git **
4. in your bash terminal, run "sudo apt update" and type in your password

5. run "sudo apt install git", then run "git --version" to verify it installed




** Navigate to your preferred directory and clone the github repo **
6. run "ls", this stands for "list" and will show you the sub-folders of your current folder

7. navigate to the folder in which you want to clone the github repository by typing "cd <folder-name>" 
    where <folder-name> is the name of the sub-folder shown by running "ls"
    (the standard is to create a "repos" folder in your root folder by running "mkdir repos" and then run "cd repos" to enter it)

8. run "git clone https://github.com/BradBear19/Location-Based-Web-Crawler.git"
    6.1 It may ask you to enter your name and email, just enter what corresponds to your github



** Install Dependencies to get server to run **
7. run "cd Location-Based-Web-Crawler" to change directories to the github repo you just cloned

8. run "cd server" to enter the server directory

9. run "npm i express pg cors" to install express.js, postgres, and cross-origin resource sharing, also run "npm install nodemon"

10. run "nodemon index" inside of the "server" folder to start the server on your machine

11. run "cd ../client" to change directories to the client directory

** Set up Database **
12. Go to www.pgadmin.org, install pgadmin 4

13. Open pgadmin 4, right-click on "Servers" in the left menu, select "Register", "Server..."

14. Name it whatever you want in "General", go to "Connection", and set Host name to localhost and port to whatever port number you want to use (5432 should be good)

15. set Username to whatever you want it to be (be sure to remember this name!)

16. Copy code found in server/sql-scripts/01-schema.sql, paste in pgadmin 4 and execute

17. do the same as above for 02-indexes.sql

** Set up .env file and populate with appropriate data **
18. create a file in the "server" folder named ".env"

19. copy the following and paste in your .env file:

PGUSER=
PGPASSWORD=
PGHOST=localhost
PGPORT=5432
PGDATABASE=webcrawler_db

20. next to PGUSER, type in the username you made in step 15
21. for PGPASSWORD, type in your postgres password you made (if applicable)
22. put localhost for PGHOST, the port you chose in 14 for PGPORT, and the name you chose in 14 for PGDATABASE

** Set up client **
23. Change directories to the "client" by opening a new bash terminal (same process as step 2 & 3) and running "cd Location-Based-Web-Crawler/client"

- run npm install

24. run "npm start" to start the client. If you visit localhost:3000 on your web browser, you should see the front-end

25. All set up! Add in data to your database from the front end as you please!
